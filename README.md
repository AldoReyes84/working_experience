# Instructor Developer Program Dashboard –

## Applicants Pipeline

As a Program Analyst, my role was to provide accurate and timely information regarding the status of the Instructor Developer Program.

Initially, the program operated on Salesforce, and my first assignment was to build a dashboard—either using Salesforce Dashboards or Power BI.

I chose Power BI due to its superior versatility, which allowed for more dynamic reporting capabilities than those offered by Salesforce Reports and Dashboards.

To connect Power BI to the data source, I configured the necessary drivers to access Salesforce Objects (tables).

The data model was based on the following tables: FactLearningPlan, FactCertifiedStatus, FactInstructorActivity, DimAccounts, DimGeo, DimDate, DimCourses, DimLearningPlans, and DimInstructorSponsors.

The main requirement was to build an applicant pipeline that visualized the status of learning plans and courses—both in overview and with drill-down capabilities. This enabled Program Managers and Instructor Sponsors to identify and support specific applicants in pursuing their certifications

This dashboard displays the total number of current applicants in the pipeline.

It includes drill-down functionality for each Learning Program, allowing users to filter and view specific program overviews.

Visual elements such as geography, sponsor, and company act as interactive filters. This feature was particularly useful for sponsors to review applicants they supported, or for stakeholders working with a specific company.

There were three prerequisites required to enroll in the program, followed by an Introduction Plan that was mandatory for all Learning Plans.

The Course Status visualization also functions as a filter, enabling users to segment applicants by course status. These filters can be combined using the Ctrl key for multi-selection.

The color scheme was designed to reflect the progression of statuses—from inactive to institutional grading—with a special highlight on the “Pending Approval” status, as this required action from the Program Manager.

The Applicant Status table was tailored to each Learning Plan, providing detailed insights into individual applicant progress. This table could be exported to Excel for further analysis.

A custom DAX measure called “Days Inactive” was implemented to calculate the number of days since the applicant’s last recorded activity, using a field provided by Salesforce
